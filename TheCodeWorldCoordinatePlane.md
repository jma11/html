### The CodeWorld Coordinate Plane

### Essential Knowledge

In programming, a line with an equal sign is called a **definition**. A definition has a **name** to the left of the equal sian, and a **value** to the right of the equal sign. 

In CodeWorld, the computer always looks at the definition of **main** firs. When it reads the value associate with **main**, the computer will find names that are built into the system, but it may also find names that are defined in the code written by you. 

Built in names in CodeWorld include <small>drawingOf, solidRectangle, coordinatePlane</small> and <small>text</small>.

**Q1.** Open <a href="http://dirtyrice.phys.lsu.edu:8080/#PvA_8Q2BDuXC6vakCJ-yRpQ" target="_blank"><u style="color: blue">this CodeWorld page</u></a>. (<a href="http://dirtyrice.phys.lsu.edu:8080/help/Lessons/Codes/u2c1l3x1.txt" target="_blank"><u style="color: blue">code</u></a>) You will see 3 panels.

The panel with the code is called the ___________ panel.

The panel with the graphics is called the ____________ panel.

The panel with the warning is called the ____________ panel.

Describe whatever it is that you can see in the output panel.

Copy in the document file the message shown on the console.

The editor has numbers at the beginnin of each line. These are called **line numbers.** Copy on the document file line number 3 in the editor.

**Q2.** What are the coordinates of the **bottom left** corner of the graphics shown in the output panel?

**Q3.** What are the coordinates of the **top right** corner of the graphics?

**Q4.** The graphics use their own unit of measure, which we will call **display units** 

How many display units **wide** are the graphics shown in the output panel?

**Q5.** How many display units **high** are the graphics?

**Q6.** Look at Line 5 in the editing panel. In this definition, the name "bar" is defined as which value?

**Q7.** In the context of the code, a <small>bar</small> is a solid black rectangle that is 10 display units wide and 1 display unit high. Is the bar displayed on the output?

**Q8.** To show the bar, go to line 1 in the editor and replace the word <small>picture</small> with the word <small>bar</small>. Then click the Run icon. 

Can you see the bar now?

**Q9.**  However, there is something that you could see before, but you cannot see now. What is it?

**Q10.** Read the warning message in the console panel. Describe what the message says and explain why your think it says that.
