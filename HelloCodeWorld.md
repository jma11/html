### Hello, CodeWorld

**Objective**: Introduce the <small> text </small> function to convert a character string into a picture

When people learn a new language, it is traditional to start with a program that prints the text "Hello, World" to the output. Here is how to do this in CodeWorld.

1. Start <a href="http://dirtyrice.phys.lsu.edu:8080" target="_blank"><u style="color: blue">a fresh new CodeWorld page.</u></a>

2. In CodeWorld, type your name preceded by two dahes and a space:

    --YOUR NAME HERE
    
    
 3. Remember: **Your name must always be included in the code you submit.**
 4. Leave a blank a line after your name.
 5. Tye the following code into the editor panel:
  
    main = drawingOf(text("Hello, World"))
    
    
 6. Run the code.
 
 Notice that the double quotes around "Hello, World" are not displayed. Double quotes are used in code to let the computer know that the text inside them is to be understood as a text for human users. In code, this type of Text inside double quotes is sometimes called a String. 
 
You can replace the Text "Hello, World" with a different Text.

In CodeWorld, the word ```drawingOf``` is used to let the system know which object we want to show in the output.
